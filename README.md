A study on Fentanyl and accidental overdose deaths. Used K-mode clustering on Multiple Cause Mortality Report data from the CDC to generate a model of vulnerable populations, of those who accidentally overdose on Fentanyl. Then, built XGBoost models for feature importance, i.e, which features were most important in predicting accidental overdose deaths. Then, we tailored both harm and reduction methods based off these profiles.
